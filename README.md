### App Description
`TODO://` I followed the youtube video to make my first ios app for the pre-work assignment. When you click on the change text color button, the black text that says Hello from Lyneisha will change to purple. Then I cotinued on with the optional features and added a button to change the background color to blue and andother button that changes the text and always leaves the text field empty. Also when you tap the view button the text and background color resets.

### App Walk-though
